            <p>
              My first car was a 1963 Ford Falcon Sprint with a broken
              speedometer and a working tachometer. Armed with a few
              mathematical formulas and an Apple IIe, I wrote a program in basic
              to calculate speed using the RPM displayed on the tachometer. I
              fell in love with programming that day. I held a variety of jobs
              over the years, but programming was always something more for me.
              I learned several languages in college including Basic, Pascal, C,
              and C++. Even though I took a different career path, I wrote a few
              applications during the early days.

              I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in electrical engineering from
              Louisiana Tech and a law degree from George Washington University.
              I am looking for more interesting challenges and have stopped
              practicing patent law to focus on software development.

              Early in my career I worked at the United States Patent and
              Trademark Office in the area of multicomputer data transferring,
              think HTTP. I was there when my coworker issued a notice of
              allowance in a patent application to Netscape Communications. The
              application became U.S. patent number 5,774,670. It was the first
              patent on cookies.
